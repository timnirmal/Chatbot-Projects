Dataset:

https://github.com/jackfrost1411/Generative-chatbot

- I removed that data set and connect reddit one which named trainM.txt and trainR.txt

### 2022-02-15

I trained with two datasets.

Model with Reddit data are currenly in main folder and other one is in Previous Model folder.


TODO: Chunk data set to be processed
TODO: Remove newlinechar from the dataset
TODO: Remove non letters, common chars, or Numbers because that gives some problems.
